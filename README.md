# 2048-cram

[Play 2048-cram now](http://glebbahmutov.com/2048-cram/)

It is a clone of [2048 5x5](https://github.com/bahmutov/2048)
with an occasional popup question to let you cram JavaScript topics.
If you answer the question correctly - the pieces move, otherwise
they stay put, plus new tiles appear. Basically you lose a turn
by answering incorrectly.

The questions can have zero, one, several or all correct answers.
